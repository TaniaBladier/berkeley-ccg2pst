1) Running code:

On a sample of CCGbank:
./src/convert.py sample.gold_ptb sample.ccgbank -print_comparison -prefix=sample.ccgbank -verbose -method=markedup ./src/markedup

On a sample of C&C Parser output:
./src/convert.py sample.gold_ptb sample.candc -print_comparison -prefix=sample.candc -verbose -method=markedup ./src/markedup

Conversion output will be in:
